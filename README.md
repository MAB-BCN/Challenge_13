# Challenge_13

Venture Funding with Deep Learning
I created a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business if funded by Alphabet Soup, a venture capital fund.

STEP !: prepared the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model

STEP 2: Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network

STEP 3: Optimize the neural network model

Example: Alternative model 1

CONCLUSION: 
The original model and alternative model 2 had similar accuracy results, whereas alternative model 1 had lower accuracy results than model 1. As such, I would propose to use the original binary classification model for evalutating applications from startups.
